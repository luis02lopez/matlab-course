%% Open and Run the Example
% Open and run the app. Change the default values in the *f1* and *f2* 
% fields to change the frequency for each component sine wave. You can also change 
% the three numbers (separated by colons) in the *t* field. The first and 
% last numbers specify the window of time to sample the function. The middle 
% number specifies the sampling rate.
%
% Press the *Plot* button to see the graph of the function in the frequency
% and time domains.
